This file has the intention to explain the variables in the data sets.
The thing is, the .zip file already contains info (explained really good) about the variables units, how were they measured, acquired, sampled, etc.
The last data set that the project generates work with the values already explained, so the resultant units are the same as they were explained in the .zip file.
(I did said this file had the intention, but only that)
